# Go Types & Null Values

## Basic Types
Go comes with a couple of built-in basic types:
- `int` =>  A number **WITHOUT** decimal places (e.g., `-5`, `10`, `12` etc)
- `float64` => A number **WITH** decimal places (e.g., `-5.2`, `10.123`, `12.9` etc)
- `string` => A text value (created via double quotes or backticks: `"Hello World"`, `Hi everyone`)
- `bool` => `true` or `false`

But there also are some noteworthy *"niche"* basic types which we will typically not need that often but which you should still know about:
- `uint` => An unsigned integer which means a strictly non-negative integer (e.g., `0`, `10`, `255` etc)
- `int32` => A 32-bit signed integer, which is an integer with a specific range from `-2,147`, `483`, `648` to `2,147,483,647` (e.g., `-1234567890`, `1234567890`)
- `rune` => An alias for `int32`, represents a Unicode code point (i.e., a single character), and is used when dealing with Unicode characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'Ã±'`, `'ä¸–'`)
- `uint32` => A 32-bit unsigned integer, an integer that can represent values from `0` to `4,294,967,295`
- `int64` => A 64-bit signed integer, an integer that can represent a larger range of values, specifically from `-9`, `223`, `372`, `036`, `854`, `775,808` to `9`, `223`, `372`, `036`, `854`, `775,807`
- There also are more types like `int8` or `uint8` which work in the same way (=> integer with smaller number range)

## Null Values
All Go value types come with a so-called **"null value"** which is the value stored in a variable if no other value is explicitly set.\

For example, the following `int` variable would have a default value of `0` (because `0` is the null value of `int`, `int32` etc):
> var age int // age is 0

Here's a list of the null values for the different types:
- `int` => `0`
- `float64` => `0.0`
- `string` => `""` (*an empty string*)
- `bool` => `false`
