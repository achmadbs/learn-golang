# Basics

For my reference, i'd like to write about basic Go programming in this section.
Such as:

- Brief introduction about Go.
- Variables, string & numbers.
- Loops.
- Boolean & Conditionals.
- Standart Library.
- Use the go command to run code.
- Use the go package.
- Functions call.
- Call functions of an external module.

To kickstart my journey, let's write the classic “Hello World!”. :star_struck:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```
